### Sprint boot interceptor 
To work with interceptor, you need to create @Component class that supports it and it should implement the HandlerInterceptor interface.

The following are the three methods you should know about while working on Interceptors −

preHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the request to the controller. This method should return true to return the response to the client.

postHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the response to the client.

afterCompletion() method − This is used to perform operations after completing the request and response.

Annotate method using JSR-250 @RolesAllowed
Use Spring’s Pre and Post invocation Annotations
Match method using Pointcuts
